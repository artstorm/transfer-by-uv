Transfer By UV v1.1
===================
LightWave Modeler LScript.

Programmed by Johan Steen.
Variation of an idea by Lee Perry-Smith. http://www.ir-ltd.net/


Description
===========
Transfers Vertex Maps from one mesh to another mesh by matching their
UV layout. Useful when proportions differ or point order has been broken.


Usage
=====
See http://www.artstorm.net/plugins/transfer-by-uv/ for usage instructions.


Installation
============
* Copy JS_TransferByUV.lsc to LightWave’s plug-in folder.
* If "Autoscan Plugins" is enabled, just restart LightWave and it's installed.

* Else, locate the “Add Plugins” button in LightWave and add them manually.

I’d recommend to add the plugin to a convenient spot in LightWave’s menu,
so all you have to do is press the Transfer by UV button when you need to
use it.


Compability
===========
Transfer by UV has been tested with LightWave 3D 9.6, Win32, Win64.
